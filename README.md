# Mushroom_Classification_Deployment
Project Showcase: Mushroom Classification App with Streamlit
Proud to share a production-ready machine learning web app I built using Streamlit, scikit-learn, and Python. 
The app classifies mushrooms based on their features and delivers intuitive predictions through a clean, branded UI.

ML Pipeline: Random Forest Classifier with label encoding and StandardScaler

Professional UI: Fully styled with custom branding, logo, and favicon

Evaluation Suite: Accuracy metrics, confusion matrix, classification report

Real-Time Prediction: Interactive input components for live classification
Designed for clarity, modularity, and reusability â€” ready for real-world deployment.

Project includes:

Model training + evaluation

Streamlit interface with navigation

Branding elements and GitHub documentation (README, requirements.txt)

Built end-to-end by me as a demonstration of scalable and elegant ML delivery.
